In this project, two players compete for the first player to reach a 100 points. On rolling a die, a random number between 1 and 6 is generated and on each player's turn, they get to roll the die multiple times until they roll a 1. If they do not roll a 1, their score stacks up and they can choose to hold the score or keep rolling but on rolling a 1, they loose all the stacked up scores.

It's the scores that are being held that keep stacking up till the first player gets to 100 points and that player is the winner.
